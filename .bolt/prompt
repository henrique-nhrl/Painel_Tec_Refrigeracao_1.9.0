For all designs I ask you to make, make them beautiful, non-standard. Create fully featured, production-worthy web pages.

For all tweaks I ask you to make, make them fully featured and production-worthy.

By default, this template supports JSX syntax with Tailwind CSS classes, React hooks, and Lucide React for icons. Do not install other packages for UI themes, icons, etc. unless absolutely necessary or I request them.

Use icons from lucide-react for logos.

Use stock photos from Unsplash when appropriate, only valid URLs that you know exist. Do not download the images, just link to them in the image tags.
